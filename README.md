A simple application to calculate the odds of the Millennium Falcon successfully reaching Endor and saving the galaxy. This solution implements both CLI and web interfaces for computing probabilities based on complex route calculations and Empire interceptor locations.

## üìã Problem Statement

This project implements a solution for computing the probability of the Millennium Falcon reaching Endor before the Death Star destroys the planet. The calculation takes into account various factors including:

Route optimization with fuel constraints
Empire bounty hunter presence
Time-based countdown mechanics
Multiple possible paths and refueling strategies

- Route optimization with fuel constraints
- Empire bounty hunter presence
- Time-based countdown mechanics
- Multiple possible paths and refueling strategies

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack


### Backend
- Python 3.8+ for core logic
- Streamlit for web server implementation
- SQLite for route database
- Key libraries:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `networkx` for graph calculations
  - `sqlite3` for database interactions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

#### Galaxy Class
The heart of the application, implementing core game logic:

```python
class Galaxy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.empire = None
        self.millennium_falcon = None
```

Key Methods:
- `read_ROUTES()`: Database interaction for route retrieval
- `create_Graph()`: Graph construction from route data
- `find_feasible_paths()`: Path calculation within autonomy constraints
- `find_acceptable_paths()`: Direct path validation against countdown
- `find_alternative_paths()`: Alternative route calculation with delays
- `give_me_the_odds()`: Final probability computation with optimal path

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Streamlit framework
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas networkx streamlit
  ```

### Command Line Usage
```bash
python give-me-the-odds.py <millennium-falcon.json> <empire.json>
```

### Web Application Launch
```bash
streamlit run webapp.py
```
